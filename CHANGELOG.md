## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added

#### Production Readiness
- **Root package documentation** (doc.go) for improved discoverability
- Comprehensive package-level documentation across all patterns
- Production deployment guide with best practices
- Error handling patterns guide
- Migration guide from other libraries

#### API Improvements
- **Consistent constructor signatures** - All patterns now use Config by value
- **Clean error package naming** - Renamed to `ferrors` to avoid stdlib conflicts
- Zero import aliasing required throughout codebase

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed timeout callback goroutine leak** - Callbacks now execute synchronously
- **Fixed bulkhead worker lifecycle** - Clear shutdown semantics with Close()
- **Fixed token bucket edge cases** - Overflow protection and division-by-zero handling
- **Documented concurrency semantics** - Clear thread-safety guarantees

#### Quality Assurance
- Zero goroutine leaks verified with race detector
- Zero race conditions across all packages
- 80%+ test coverage on all packages
- All critical production issues resolved

### Changed
- Constructor signature: `retry.New()` now takes `Config` by value (was pointer)
- Package rename: `errors` → `ferrors` for cleaner imports
- Timeout callbacks execute synchronously to prevent leaks
- Bulkhead `Close()` signals shutdown but doesn't wait (user coordinates)

### Fixed
- Timeout goroutine leak from unbounded callback spawning
- Bulkhead WaitGroup race condition between Execute() and Close()
- Token bucket waitTime() race condition (documented as best-effort)
- Token bucket refill overflow from clock skew or system sleep
- Division-by-zero edge cases in token bucket calculations

### Documentation
- Added root doc.go for pkg.go.dev integration
- V1_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md - Complete v1.0 overview
- V1_FINAL_STATUS.md - Production readiness certification
- Enhanced inline documentation for all edge cases
- Clear resource cleanup semantics

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- Minor bug fixes and documentation improvements

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

#### Core Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker** pattern with three states (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
  - Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
  - State change callbacks for monitoring
  - Request counting with sliding window
  - Type-safe with Go generics

- **Retry** pattern with intelligent backoff strategies
  - Exponential, linear, and constant backoff policies
  - Configurable jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Custom retry predicates for error handling
  - Maximum attempt and delay limits

- **Rate Limiter** using token bucket algorithm
  - Per-key rate limiting
  - Configurable rate, burst, and interval
  - Both blocking (Wait) and non-blocking (Allow) operations
  - Context-aware cancellation

- **Timeout** pattern with context propagation
  - Configurable default and per-operation timeouts
  - Automatic context deadline enforcement
  - Timeout callbacks for monitoring

- **Bulkhead** pattern for concurrency limiting
  - Semaphore-based concurrency control
  - Queue management with configurable capacity
  - Dual semaphore design preventing race conditions
  - Request statistics tracking

#### Integration
- **Middleware Chain** for composable pattern orchestration
  - Fluent API for building resilience chains
  - Right-to-left composition order
  - Support for all core patterns
  - Type-safe execution

- **HTTP Middleware** for standard http.Handler
  - CircuitBreaker, RateLimit, and Timeout middleware
  - Thread-safe response recording
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes (503, 429, 504)
  - Flexible key extraction (IP, headers)

- **gRPC Interceptors** for unary and streaming RPCs
  - Unary and stream interceptors for all patterns
  - Metadata-based key extraction
  - Standard gRPC status codes
  - Context propagation support

#### Observability
- **Structured Logging** with log/slog integration
  - Pattern-specific log helpers
  - Event and metric logging functions
  - Configurable log levels

- **OpenTelemetry Tracing** support
  - Distributed tracing integration
  - Pattern-specific span creation
  - Attribute and event recording
  - Error tracking

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- API documentation with inline comments

### Performance
- <1µs overhead for all patterns
- Zero allocations in hot paths
- Concurrent execution with race-free guarantees
- Optimized for production workloads

### Testing
- >95% test coverage across all packages
- Race detection on all tests
- Comprehensive benchmarks
- Fuzz testing for backoff algorithms
